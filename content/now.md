<h3>Iâ€™m home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberjaya">Cyberjaya</a>, Malaysia.</h3>

<h3>What am I doing right now:</h3>

<h2><strong>I'm actively looking for a full time remote job</strong></h2>
<h3>It's a long overdue. This site is up for that reason.</h3> 
<h3>Hoping to land one soon. Fingers crossed.</h3>

<h2><strong>Relearning Javascript from the basic</strong></h2>
<h3>As I mentioned previously, I neglected Javascript during my front-end learning and went straight to Rails.</h3> 
<h3>Almost one year has passed and seems the demands has changed as well. To be fair, I love Javascript. But being a sucker to "new" tech, I went to the dark(er) side. #theLastJediRocks :P</h3>

<h2><strong>Still actively running at the local events</strong></h2>
<h3>I have two upcoming events in 2018. Would update my running calendar at "running page" but that's not the priority right now.</h3>
<h3>So I'll be running 12KM at Twincity Marathon Cyberjaya in January and half marathon at Standard Chartered KL-Marathon in April.</h3>
<h3>I'm on 10KM running plan since November 2017, slacking off abit but getting there.</h3>
