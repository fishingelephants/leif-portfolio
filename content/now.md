<h3>Iâ€™m home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberjaya">Cyberjaya</a>, Malaysia.</h3>

<h3>What am I doing right now:</h3>

<h2><strong>I'm actively looking for a full time remote job.</strong></h2>
<h3>It's a long overdue. Currently getting the personal cum CV cum portfolio site up for this challenge.</h3> 
<h3>Hoping to land one soon. Fingers crossed.</h3>

<h2><strong>Resharpening my frontend development skills</strong></h2>
<h3>I'm revisiting alot of frontend stuff lately, mainly Javascript.</h3> 
<h3>It's one thing that I skipped alot because I was too focus on Ruby On Rails.</h3>

<h2><strong>Still actively running the local events</strong></h2>
<h3>I have two upcoming events in 2018. Would update my running calendar at "running page" but that's not the priority right now.</h3>
<h3>So I'll be running 12KM at Twincity Marathon Cyberjaya in January and half marathon at Standard Chartered KL-Marathon in April.</h3>
<h3>I'm on 10KM running plan since November 2017, slacking off abit but getting there.</h3>
