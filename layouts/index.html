            <h1><strong>I'm {{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong>.</h1>
            <h3>I'm a freelance Full Stack Developer and Support Specialist, working remotely.</a></h3>
            <h3>By day, I work as Wintel Engineer at a German multinational company. Which means I run and maintained Windows servers for corporate clients.</h3> 
            <h3>You can check my CV <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/">here</a>. My web projects are <a href="/portfolio">here</a>, and also at <a href="https://github.com/{{ .Site.Params.Social.Github }}">Github</a>.</h3>
            <h3>I've been a musician. And my band used to rock the local chart but shortlived. I ended up being a <a href="/history">guitar pedal geek</a> for years.</h3>
            <h3>I'm recently fascinated with being minimalist. The reason why I make this page plain and neat. My current obsession are running and actively joining <a href="/running">marathon</a> events. Occasionally I share my thoughts on <a href="https://medium.com/{{ .Site.Params.Social.Medium }}">medium</a>. Check out my <a href="/now">NOW page</a>, to see what am I doing now. It will change through time.</h3>
            <h3>You can find me at the social media below. Love to chat, do holler.</h3>
